# About this project

A few weeks into the HTML/CSS and Javascript courses, i decided that a good first project would be to create some sort of portfolio page.

The biggest issue was that i did not have any projects or any specific knowledge that would be displayed in a portfolio but also that i did not really know what i would be capable of creating, when these two courses started.

However i decided that i would do it anyway, since the project for these courses arent really about the content that is shown in the portfolo but rather the portfolio itself and the tecniques used during the process.

So this project contains alot of placeholders and Lorem text. In the future i hope to continue to build on this and replace the Lorem and other placeholders with actual content and real projects.

# Development experience

I started this project with alot of stress about making it in time. But now at the end of this i feel like i had the time i needed. Biggest issue was that when this project started alot of the tecniques i know today, was not known to me. So i think that i can see the result of that quite clearly in my code that some parts are very basic, since thats what i knew when this project started, while some parts of this project is a bit more refined and advanced and include alot of the tecniques that i learned towards the end of this course.

In the end i could have opted to go back and update the more basic parts to the more advanced in order to make the code feel more cohesive and perhaps even more readable, but i kind of like to see the progress that has been made and be reminded of that there was a time before i thought about including for example :

"Display:flex, Justify-content:center and align-items:center" - into their own class, and then add that class to each HTML element that i wanted it on - instead of typing these 3 over and over again. I guess its an alternative to a Mixin.

The same thing could have been done alot more with code that are reoccuring in the project, and i would have done that if i started this project today.

I also incorporated Css variables towards the end, and ended up just doing variables for some coloring while this could have been done to alot more Css if i would have started this project today instead.

Hopefully opting to not go back and update it wont ruin this for me too much..

I tend to assign classes to pretty much everything in HTLM in order to get as clear references as possible in the CSS file later. Im not sure if over useing classes is a thing(?), ill have to ask Alex or Martin.. but i think that the CSS is alot more readable, and does not need as much of commenting when the classes speaks for themself. I dont have to write a comment stating "This is for the contact me button" if the class itself is called .contact-button.

I had a hard time picking out Js for this project but ultimatly ended up with a formvalidation, a observer for the animations on .about and a darkmode/lightmode and i feel quite happy with that for this page as it is right now.
